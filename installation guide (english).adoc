== Setting up ROS 2 on Raspberry Pi

=== Installing the Raspberry Pi Image

1. Download and install the official Raspberry Pi Imager from https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/.
2. Choose the following parameters:
   - Operating System: Other general-purpose OS/Ubuntu/Ubuntu Server 22.04.3 LTS (64-bit).

=== Connecting to Your Raspberry Pi Using SSH

1. Connect the Raspberry Pi to Ethernet (either directly to your PC or to your local network).
2. Find out the IP address of your Pi.

    To find the IP address of your Raspberry Pi, you can use one of the following methods:

    Using the Router Interface:
    1. Log in to your router's web interface. This typically involves entering the router's IP address into a web browser.
    2. Look for a section named "Connected Devices," "DHCP Clients," or similar. This section should list all devices connected to the network along with their assigned IP addresses.
    3. Find the entry corresponding to your Raspberry Pi

    Using a Network Scanner App (if connected to the same network):
    1. Use a network scanner app on your smartphone, tablet or pc.
    2. Scan the local network for connected devices, and look for the Raspberry Pi.



3. Open the command prompt or terminal and type the following command:

    ssh ubuntu@<ip address of the pi>

4. Enter the password when prompted (default password: ubuntu).

=== Installing ROS 2 Humble

1. Follow the installation guide at https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html to install ROS 2 Humble.
2. Alternatively, run the installation script from https://github.com/tBuddy00/Follow-Me-Roboter/blob/main/src/setup/install_ros2_humble.sh.

=== Creating the Workspace

1. If you encounter issues, follow the tutorial at https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Colcon-Tutorial.html.
2. Alternatively, run the installation script from https://github.com/tBuddy00/Follow-Me-Roboter/blob/main/src/setup/create_workspace.sh.
3. To manually create the workspace, execute the following commands:

    mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
    cd ~/ros2_ws/src

== Setting Up the Camera

=== Installing the Camera Driver

1. Use the _ros2_v4ls_camera_ from https://github.com/tier4/ros2_v4l2_camera/tree/galactic.
2. Follow this link:https://gaseoustortoise.notion.site/Raspberry-Pi-Camera-bc33c733eeb4417cbd5e3db027a3a429[guide] for installation instructions. 
3. To check if the camera is working, open a second terminal, connect to the Pi, and run:

    ros2 topic list

- If `/image_raw` shows up, the camera is working. 
4. Use ctrl + c to stop the camera.

=== Installing OpenCV and cv_bridge

1. Use the _vision_opencv_ repository from https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv.
2. Install dependencies:

    sudo apt install python3-numpy
    sudo apt install libboost-python-dev

3. Clone the repository:

    cd ~/ros2_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv.git -b humble
    cd ~/ros2_ws
    colcon build --symlink-install

4. Install _Python3-opencv_:

    sudo apt install python3-opencv

=== Installing the Camera Package

1. Clone the camera_package repository:

    cd ~/ros2_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/cl-ire/camera_package.git NOTE: Platzhalter, später anderer Pfad
    cd ~/ros2_ws
    colcon build --symlink-install

== Testing the Camera

1. Create a directory for images:

    cd
    mkdir image

2. Start the camera:

    cd
    ros2 run v4l2_camera v4l2_camera_node --ros-args -p image_size:="[640,480]"

3. Open a second terminal, connect to the Pi, and run:

    ros2 topic list

- If `/image_raw` shows up, the camera is running.

4. Run the camera_package node:

    ros2 run camera_package camera_s NOTE: kann sich noch ändern

- This should save an image in the previously created `image` directory.
5. If you see the image, the camera is working.
