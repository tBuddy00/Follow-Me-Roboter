== Introduction

This guide provides instructions on how to set up a ROS 2 environment on a Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano. It also includes instructions on how to install the necessary packages for the Follow-Me Robot project.

The project offers two different platforms for running the Follow-Me Robot, which can be partially combined.

Choose the main processing computer: +
- Raspberry Pi 4 +
- Jetson Nano +

Choose the platform for the Robot: +
- Waveshare Alphabot2 +
- Arduino Uno and Adafruit Motor Shield v2.3 +

Recommended Setup: +
- Jetson Nano + Arduino Uno & Adafruit Motor Shield v2.3 +
or +
- Raspberry Pi 4 + Waveshare Alphabot2 +

Raspberry Pi 4 with the Arduino Uno and Adafruit Motor Shield v2.3 is also possible without any problems. It is not recommended to use the Jetson Nano with the Waveshare Alphabot2 because Waveshare Alphabot2 isn't built for the Jetson Nano.

Depending on the chosen platform, follow the corresponding instructions in the guide.


== Setting up Raspberry Pi (skip if using Jetson Nano)

=== Installing Ubuntu Server 22.04.3 LTS (64-bit) on Raspberry Pi

Download and install the official Raspberry Pi Imager from link:https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/[Raspberry Pi Software]. +
Choose the following parameters:

* Operating System: `Other general-purpose OS/Ubuntu/Ubuntu Server 22.04.3 LTS (64-bit)`.


== Setting up Jetson Nano (skip if using Raspberry Pi)

=== Installing Ubuntu Server 22.04.3 LTS (64-bit) on Jetson Nano

(add later)


== Connecting to Your Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano Using SSH

Connect the Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano to Ethernet either directly to your PC or to your local network. +

Find out the IP address of your Pi or Jetson Nano by using one of the following methods:

- Using the Router Interface:
  1. Log in to your router's web interface. This typically involves entering the router's IP address into a web browser.
  2. Look for a section named "Connected Devices," "DHCP Clients," or similar. This section should list all devices connected to the network along with their assigned IP addresses.
  3. Find the entry corresponding to your Raspberry Pi.
- Using a Network Scanner App (if connected to the same network):
  1. Use a network scanner app on your smartphone, tablet, or PC.
  2. Scan the local network for connected devices, and look for the Raspberry Pi.

Open the command prompt or terminal and type the following command:
[source,shell]
----
ssh ubuntu@<ip address of the device>
----

Enter the password when prompted (default password: ubuntu).


== Setting up Wi-Fi

_The instructions are based on link:https://gist.github.com/ExtremeGTX/ea1d1c12dde8261b263ab2fead983dc8[this guide] and modified for our use case._

=== Install required packages

[source,shell]
----
sudo apt-get install hostapd dnsmasq
----

=== Hostapd

The purpose of Hostapd is to set WiFi as an access point.

Write a new config file for Hostapd:
[source,shell]
----
sudo vi /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
----

Add the following content:
[source,shell]
----
interface=wlan0
driver=nl80211
ssid=FollowMeRobot
hw_mode=g
channel=7
wmm_enabled=0
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
wpa=2
wpa_passphrase=ubuntu1234
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=TKIP
rsn_pairwise=CCMP
----

Tell Hostapd to use our config file by editing `/etc/default/hostapd` and changing the line that starts with `#DAEMON_CONF` (remove `#`\).

[source,shell]
----
DAEMON_CONF="/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf"
----

Start Hostapd:

[source,shell]
----
sudo systemctl unmask hostapd
sudo systemctl enable hostapd
sudo systemctl start hostapd
----

=== dnsmasq

Dnsmasq acts as a DHCP Server, so when a device connects to Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano, it can get an IP assigned to it.

Make a backup of the default config:
[source,shell]
----
sudo cp /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf.org
----

Create a new config file:
[source,shell]
----
sudo vi /etc/dnsmasq.conf
----
_This config file will automatically assign addresses between `192.168.4.2` and `192.168.4.20` with lease time 24 hours._
Add the following content:
[source,shell]
----
interface=wlan0
dhcp-range=192.168.4.2,192.168.4.20,255.255.255.0,24h
----

Reload dnsmasq config:

[source,shell]
----
sudo systemctl reload dnsmasq
----

=== Solving Startup Error

On system startup, dnsmasq will not wait for the wlan0 interface to initialize and will fail with error `wlan0 not found`.

We need to tell systemd to launch it after the network gets ready, so we will modify dnsmasq service file by adding `After=` and `Wants=` under `[Unit]` section.

[source,shell]
----
sudo vi /lib/systemd/system/dnsmasq.service
----

Add the following lines under `[Unit]`:
[source,shell]
----
[Unit]
...
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target
----

=== Config Static IP

Ubuntu uses cloud-init for initial setup, following file needs to be modified to set the wlan0 IP.

Modify the cloud-init file:
[source,shell]
----
sudo vi /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
----

Add the following content to the file:

[source,shell]
----
        wlan0:
            dhcp4: false
            addresses:
            - 192.168.4.1/24
----

The final file should look like this:

[source,shell]
----
# This file is generated from information provided by
# the datasource.  Changes to it will not persist across an instance.
# To disable cloud-init's network configuration capabilities, write a file
# /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg with the following:
# network: {config: disabled}
network:
    version: 2
    ethernets:
        eth0:
            dhcp4: true
            match:
                macaddress: 12:34:56:78:ab:cd
            set-name: eth0
        wlan0:
            dhcp4: false
            addresses:
            - 192.168.4.1/24
----

Finally, reboot your Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano and check if you can connect to it via WiFi and SSH.
