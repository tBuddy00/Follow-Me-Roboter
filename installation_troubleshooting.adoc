
== Problems with the WiFi

first check what isnt working by running the following command

[source,shell]
----
# Check the status of the dnsmasq service
sudo systemctl status dnsmasq

# Check for the softblock issue
sudo rfkill list

# other useful commands
sudo systemctl status check-dnsmasq.service
sudo systemctl status unblock-wifi.service
----


=== fix softblock issue 
if your wifi network doesnt boot properly check the following command

[source,shell]
----
sudo rfkill list
sudo systemctl status dnsmasq
----
if it looks like this 

[source,shell]
----
0: phy0: Wireless LAN
        Soft blocked: yes
        Hard blocked: no
----

then you have the softblock issue to fix it we have to create a script to unblock wlan0 on boot

run the following command to create the script

[source,shell]
----
sudo vi /etc/systemd/unblock-wifi.sh
----

and add the following content

[source,shell]
----
#!/bin/bash

# Ensure that wlan0 is unblocked
sudo rfkill unblock wlan
----

then run the following command to make the script executable

[source,shell]
----
sudo chmod +x /etc/systemd/unblock-wifi.sh
----

then run the following command to create a service that runs the script on boot

[source,shell]
----
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/unblock-wifi.service
----

and add the following content

[source,shell]
----
[Unit]
Description=Unblock wifi on boot
After=network-online.target
Before=dnsmasq.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/etc/systemd/unblock-wifi.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
----

then run the following command to enable the service

[source,shell]
----
sudo systemctl enable unblock-wifi.service
sudo systemctl start unblock-wifi
----

eddit the dnsmasq service file to make sure that the unblock-wifi service runs before the dnsmasq service

[source,shell]
----
sudo vi /lib/systemd/system/dnsmasq.service
----

Add the following lines under `[Unit]`:
[source,shell]
----
[Unit]
...
After=wlan0.service
After=unblock-wifi.service
----

then reboot the device

[source,shell]
----
sudo reboot
----

=== if softblock issue still persists

if the softblock issue still persists we can try implementing a service that restarts dnsmasq service after boot 


1. Create a script to check dnsmasq status and restart if necessary:

[source,bash]
----
sudo vi /usr/local/bin/check_dnsmasq.sh
----

Add the following content to the file:

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

# Check if dnsmasq is active
if systemctl is-active --quiet dnsmasq; then
    echo "dnsmasq is already running"
else
    echo "dnsmasq is not running, attempting to restart services"
    systemctl restart unblock-wifi.service
    if systemctl restart dnsmasq; then
        echo "Successfully restarted dnsmasq"
    else
        echo "Failed to restart dnsmasq"
    fi
fi
----

Save and exit the editor (`Esc`, then `:wq`).

2. Make the script executable:

[source,bash]
----
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/check_dnsmasq.sh
----

3. Create a systemd service unit file:

[source,bash]
----
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/check-dnsmasq.service
----

Add the following content:

[source,bash]
----
[Unit]
Description=Check if dnsmasq is running and restart services if necessary
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/check_dnsmasq.sh
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
----

Save and exit the editor (`Esc`, then `:wq`).

4. Enable the service to run at boot:

[source,bash]
----
sudo systemctl enable check-dnsmasq.service
----

5. Test the service:

[source,bash]
----
sudo systemctl start check-dnsmasq.service
sudo systemctl status check-dnsmasq.service
----

You should see the status of the service, including the echo statements from the script.
